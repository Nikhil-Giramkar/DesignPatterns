Shallow copy (clone by reference)
-------------
Whenver we simply clone an object from another.
Its shallow copy is created.
Meaning, if an Object 1 contains some other object (Obj X)
Then when we create a clone of Object 1 as Object 2, then reference of Obj X is added in Object 2.

Due to which, when changes are made in Obj X for any objects 1 or 2.
Then its results will get reflected for both 1 and 2. Since they point to same memory location of ObjX


Deep copy (clone by Value)
--------
In this method, we create a new instance of Obj X for cloned object (Object 2).
So that each object 1 and 2 has their own copy of Obj X.
