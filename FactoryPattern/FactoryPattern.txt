When there is a super class and multiple child classes
And we want to create the child class based o input received from user
In such case, we create a factory class that takes responsibility of object creation
Where user is unaware of how objects are getting created

Advantage:
1. Focus on creating object for interface rater than implementation
2. Loose coupling and robust code
