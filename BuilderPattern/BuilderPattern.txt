In Factory pattern
We pass some parameters and create an object like EmployeeType
Suppose we want to create a complex object for which we need to pass multiple parameters
1. In such case we need to pass all parameters, keep in mind the sequence of paramaters
2. If a parameter is optional, we need to overload one more constructor and 
create all possibilities of making that object

In Builder pattern
We create object step by step
And finally return object with desired attributes
This pattern mostly used to create immutable objects
